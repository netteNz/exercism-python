# Study Agent Rules (Exercism Java Track)

- Only read/write files under this Java track root directory.
- Prefer understanding tests as the source of truth.
- Default behavior: DO NOT output full working solutions for Exercism exercises in the first iteration.
  - Provide a hint ladder + pseudocode + targeted snippets only.
  - Only provide a full solution if the user explicitly asks: "give me the full solution".
- Always include:
  - Restatement of requirements
  - Edge cases
  - Complexity (time/space)
  - Java-specific best practices (immutability, StringBuilder, collections, exceptions)
  - A short "Python vs Java mapping" section when relevant
- Keep output concise but complete for study notes.
